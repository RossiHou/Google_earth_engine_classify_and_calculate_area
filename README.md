# Google_earth_engine_classify_and_calculate_area
Using gee to classify the image for every month then calculate the area(or sth) month by month.
Here, I show a case study that classifies the urban areas and then calculates the urban area percentage month by month; you can change it to whatever you like(e.g., mangrove, cropland...)
