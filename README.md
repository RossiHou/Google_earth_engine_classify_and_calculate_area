# Google_earth_engine_long_time_series_analyses
Using gee to classify the image for every month then calculate the area(or sth) month by month.
Here, I show a case study that classifies the urban areas and then calculates the urban area percentage month by month; you can change it to whatever you like(e.g., mangrove, cropland...)
PS: update the NDVI time series analyses and how to calculate the specific land use area from the dataset by year.
